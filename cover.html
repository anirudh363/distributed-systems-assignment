            <!-- <h3 style="text-align: left;">Abstract:</h3>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Efficient Data Rollover Strategies and Management is an innovative solution to transfer unused daily or monthly data of a customer to the next day or month. Excess unused data can be sold back or distributed to new customers for lesser rates thereby avoiding wastage. With the increasing importance of staying connected in today's digital world, having a reliable data plan is crucial. Many mobile carriers offer data rollover for post-paid connections whereas prepaid users lose the data if they fail to use it.</p> -->
            <!-- <h3 style="text-align: left;">Main Goal:</h3>
            <p style="text-align: left;">The main goal of this project is to make sure that all mobile users, including prepaid customers, get the most out of their data plans. It aims to prevent any unused data from going to waste. For prepaid users, the project ensures that their leftover data doesn't just disappear but can be saved for future use. Moreover, this unused data can be shared or sold at lower rates to others, reducing costs for everyone. In simpler terms, the main goal is to ensure that no data is wasted, and more people can benefit from it.</p> -->
            <!-- <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>Data Conservation: Preserve unused data for prepaid users, ensuring they don't lose what they've paid for.</li>
                <li>Fairness: Create a fair system where both prepaid and postpaid users can roll over unused data, promoting equity.</li>
                <li>Data Sharing: Enable users to share or sell their excess data to others, reducing costs for everyone.</li>
                <li>User Experience: Prioritize a user-friendly interface for managing and accessing rolled-over data.</li>
                <li>Scalability: Create a system that can handle a growing number of users and increasing amounts of rolled-over data as the project expands.</li>
            </ul> -->
            <!-- <h3 style="text-align: left;">Analysis:</h3>
            <ol style="text-align: left;">
                <li>Data Storage: <br /> <p style="text-align: left;">Unused data is securely stored in a distributed cloud storage infrastructure. This infrastructure is designed for reliability, scalability, and data redundancy to ensure data integrity and availability. Users with prepaid or postpaid mobile plans accrue data that they don't fully use during their billing cycle. The system automatically detects and identifies this unused data, often referred to as "rollover data."</p></li>
                <li>User Account Management: <br /> <p style="text-align: left;">Each user's mobile account is linked to a digital dashboard where they can monitor their data usage, rollover balance</p></li>
                <li>Rollover Preferences: <br /> <p style="text-align: left;" >Users can set preferences for how their rollover data is managed. Options may include: Automatically rolling over data to the next billing cycle. Sharing data with other users or selling it at reduced rates. Donating unused data to charitable causes.</p></li>
                <li>Data Transfer and Retrieval: <br /> <p style="text-align: left;" >When users need to access their rolled-over data, they can initiate a transfer request via their dashboard or mobile app. Distributed systems facilitate efficient and secure data retrieval, ensuring data is accessible when needed.</p></li>
                <li>Data Privacy and Security: <br /> <p style="text-align: left;" >The system incorporates robust security measures, including data encryption, user authentication, and access controls. User data and privacy are protected through industry-standard security protocols.</p></li>
                <li>User Notifications: <br /> <p style="text-align: left;" >Users receive notifications regarding their data usage, rollover balance, and any relevant promotions or offers. This ensures that users remain informed about their data status.</p></li>
                <li>Data Sharing and Community: <br /> <p style="text-align: left;" >Users can opt to share or sell their excess data to others within the same mobile carrier network. A distributed system manages data sharing, ensuring fairness, transparency, and security.</p> </li>
                <li>Billing and Reporting: <br /> <p style="text-align: left;" >The system generates detailed reports for users, showing data usage, rollover history, and any associated charges. Users can review and verify their data-related activities.</p> </li>
