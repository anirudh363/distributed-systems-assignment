            <h3 style="text-align: left;">Main Goal:</h3><p style="text-align: left;">The main goal of this project is to make sure that all mobile users, including prepaid customers, get the most out of their data plans. It aims to prevent any unused data from going to waste. For prepaid users, the project ensures that their leftover data doesn't just disappear but can be saved for future use. Moreover, this unused data can be shared or sold at lower rates to others, reducing costs for everyone. In simpler terms, the main goal is to ensure that no data is wasted, and more people can benefit from it.</p>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>Data Conservation: Preserve unused data for prepaid users, ensuring they don't lose what they've paid for.</li>
                <li>Fairness: Create a fair system where both prepaid and postpaid users can roll over unused data, promoting equity.</li>
                <li>Data Sharing: Enable users to share or sell their excess data to others, reducing costs for everyone.</li>
                <li>User Experience: Prioritize a user-friendly interface for managing and accessing rolled-over data.</li>
                <li>Scalability: Create a system that can handle a growing number of users and increasing amounts of rolled-over data as the project expands.</li>
            </ul>
